# tcl-websocket

More information will come on this one.  It is not one that you should
use at this time, but it is the start of a rewrite of Emmanuel Frecon's
([@efrecon](https://github.com/efrecon)) excellent tcllib websocket package.  

At this time the library is only handling clients and not servers as
our use-case does not require serving websockets at this time.  We will
port that over when time permits (or a pull request is more than welcome).
